Architecture

contracts = solidity smart contracts
migrations = paste smart contracts to yhe local blockchain
src =  main frontend code
    assets = images, fonts, svs etc
    components = reusable react components
    //container components containe full views
    configs = configuration files such as dapp names
    theme = configure sass, material ui
    core = core libs being used
        actions = dispatch actions
        hoc = exports enhanced react components
        libs = contains lib helpers to help js 
        reducers = contaisn the reducers
        store = main redux configuration store
            type.js = reducer types
        index.html = main app html files
        index.js = the first js file to be executed when dapp gets rendered
webpack = powers the frontend application
    common.config.babel.js = production, developemnt code. .babel helps write in ES6 solidity

package.json = defines 3rd party npm packages used in developemnt mode

.babelrc = js transpiler...translates ES6 to formats all browsers can understand

eslintrc = adhering t arnnb style guide
            = turn off/disable some rules

react router = hash router
